Project Title and Concept

Title: Student Management Application

Concept:
This web-based application helps schools or educational institutions manage student records, attendance, and academic details in an organized and efficient way.
It provides a simple interface for adding, editing, and tracking students, along with attendance monitoring — all stored locally in the browser (using Local Storage) in this frontend version.


Features Implemented in This Frontend Version

User Authentication (Frontend Only)

Simple Sign Up and Login system using Local Storage to save credentials.

Protects dashboard access if user isn’t logged in.

Dashboard View

Centralized dashboard with quick navigation to:

Manage Students

Attendance Management

Student Management

Add, edit, and delete student records (name, roll number, class, grade).

Search students by name or roll number.

Download complete student list as a CSV file.

Attendance Tracking

Mark students as Present or Absent.

Filter by class and attendance status.

Display a summary — total students, present count, absent count, and attendance percentage.

Local Data Persistence

All data (users and student details) are stored in browser localStorage, ensuring persistence even after page reload.

Neat UI Design

Simple and user-friendly layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

uture Improvements Planned for Backend Integration

When backend integration is added (using Node.js, Express, and a database like MongoDB/MySQL), the following improvements can be implemented:

Secure Authentication System

Replace Local Storage with secure login using JWT or session-based authentication.

Store user credentials safely in a database.

Database Integration

Store student records, attendance, and grades permanently in a database.

Allow multiple teachers/admins to manage data collaboratively.

Role-Based Access Control

Different access levels for Admin (add/edit/delete) and Teacher (view/mark attendance).

Attendance Reports

Generate downloadable PDF reports and monthly summaries.
